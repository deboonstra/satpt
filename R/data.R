#' @title Emerging Infectious Network (EIN) Management of *S. aureus* Bacteremia
#' survey data
#'
#' @description Responses to survey questions about infectious disease
#' consultation for *staphylococcus aureus* bacteremia (SAB) presented to medical
#' personnel who are members of EIN.
#'
#' @details
#' Questions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are clinical case study questions, where the
#' remaining questions ask about different treatment methodologies. Questions 1
#' and 2 provide a medical history in the case study, which is excluded in
#' the descriptions of the responses for `q1` and `q2a`. These questions are
#' asking what would be the treatment strategy of an infectious disease
#' physician given the full medical history of the patients.

#'  case study.}
#'  \item{`q2`}{A `character` vector that lists the responses to question 2

#'  \item{`q3`}{A `character` vector that lists the responses to preferred

#'  \item{`q4`}{A `character` vector that lists the responses on how to treat
#'  a clinically stable patient that has MRSA bacteremia.}
#'  \item{`q5`}{A `character` vector that lists the responses on
#'  antibiotic treatment strategy for a patient with MRSA endocarditis on day 6
#'  of vancomycin with persistent positive blood cultures.}

#'  course for a 35 y/o previously healthy man with left-sided MSSA endocarditis
#'  but no meningitis or CNS disease.}

#'  The responses are focused on what conditions would increase the treatment
#'  duration from 2 weeks to 4-6 weeks assuming that a TTE and/or TEE are
#'  negative in a patient with MRSA bacteremia. If the response item was
#'  selected a value of `Yes` is reported while `No` indicates the condition was
#'  not selected.}
