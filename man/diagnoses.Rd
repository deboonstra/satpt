\subsection{\code{diagnoses}}{

A \code{list} with 3 objects that each have a length of 643.
\describe{
\item{\code{wave}}{A \code{numeric} vector that lists of the data collect period when
the responses were collected during.}
\item{\code{q1}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to the types of
advanced molecular diagnostic tests that have been ordered or used. This is
an example of responses based on select that all apply data collection
process. Possible values are \emph{Broad range 16S rRNA gene sequencing}
(\code{Broadrange}), \emph{Whole genome sequencing} (\code{Wholegenome}),
\emph{Metagenomic next-generation sequencing} (\code{MNGS}), \emph{None of the above}
(\code{None}), and \emph{Other} (\code{Other}), where the data values are listed within
the parentheses. When multiple responses are present the data values are
separated by \code{"|"}.}
\item{\code{q2}}{A \code{factor} with 5 levels for the responses to how often within
the past two years advanced molecular diagnostic testing was performed.
Possible values are \emph{Not at all}, \emph{Once}, \emph{Rarely}
(quarterly or less often), \emph{Sometimes} (monthly), and \emph{Often} (weekly).
This is an example of where the responses collected come from the multiple
choice question.}
