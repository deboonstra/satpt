\usage{
satpt(
  y,
  by = NULL,
  exclude = c(NA, NaN),
  alpha = 0.05,
  threshold = 0.05,
  names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector of values to which determine if saturation has been achieved.}

\item{by}{Vector of values which indicate when \code{y} was collected.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{exclude}{Vector of values that should be excluded in \code{y} and
\code{by}. Generally, this should be used to denote missing values. Default
is \code{NA} and \code{NaN}.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for Pearson's \eqn{\chi^2} for independence.
Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{threshold}{Saturation threshold applied to the standard errors. Default
is \code{0.05}.}

\item{names}{Character vector of names for \code{y} and \code{by} when
displaying \code{ftable} created by \code{stats::ftable}. Default is
\code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
Saturation point analysis of multinomial responses from a
survey using standard errors of the sample proportions for the responses.
}
\examples{
data(ein)

# Assuming response bias is not a possiblity
satpt::satpt(y = ein$responses)

# Examining saturation given data collected at different times and
# response bias is possible.
satpt::satpt(y = ein$responses, by = ein$wave)
