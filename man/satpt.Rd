\title{Saturation point analysis}
\usage{
satpt(
  y,
  by = NULL,
  exclude = c(NA, NaN),
  alpha = 0.05,
  threshold = 0.05,
  names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector of values to which determine if saturation has been achieved.}

\item{by}{Vector of values which indicate when \code{y} was collected.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{exclude}{Vector of values that should be excluded in \code{y} and
\code{by}. Generally, this should be used to denote missing values. Default
is \code{NA} and \code{NaN}.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for Pearson's \eqn{\chi^2} for independence.
Default is \code{0.05}.}

\item{threshold}{Saturation threshold applied to the standard errors. Default
is \code{0.05}.}

\item{names}{Character vector of names for \code{y} and \code{by} when
displaying the contingency table, sample proportions, and standard error
matrices. Default is \code{NULL}. When \code{names} is specified the first entry should
be name of \code{y} and the second entry should be name of \code{by}.}
}
\value{
An object with \code{S3} class \code{"satpt"} containing
\describe{
\item{\code{saturation}}{A logical value indicating whether all response
categories have achieved saturation given the defined \code{threshold}. The value
of \code{TRUE} indicates that saturation has been achieved while a value of
\code{FALSE} indicates that saturation was not achieved and more data is needed
to achieve saturation.}
\item{\code{counts}}{A \code{matrix} containing the observed cell counts of the
contigency table created by \code{y} and \code{by} if provided.}
\item{\code{phat}}{A \code{matrix} containing the row-wise sample proportions for the
observed contigency table (\code{counts}).}
\item{\code{se}}{A \code{matrix} containing the standard errors for the calculated
sample proportions (\code{phat}).}
\item{\code{test}}{A \code{htest} object produced by \code{\link[stats:chisq.test]{stats::chisq.test()}} containing
the results from the \eqn{\chi^2} for independence.}
\item{\code{total_obs}}{Total number of observations with a response provided.}
\item{\code{total}}{A \code{data.frame} with 5 variables describing the overall
collected sample. The \code{categories} variable provides the unique
categories listed in \code{y}. While \code{counts}, \code{phat}, and \code{se} provide the
overall cell counts, sample proportions, and standard errors for the
categories, respectively. The standard errors reported for the overall
sample proportions are calculated based on the presence of response bias,
which is detailed above. Finally, the \code{saturation} variable is a logical
variable denoting whether saturation was achieved for each individual
category given the saturation \code{threshold} defined.}
\item{\code{hindex}}{Heterogeneity index for the sample proportions calculated by
mean absolute deviation.}
}

\description{
Saturation point analysis of multinomial responses from a
survey using standard errors of the sample proportions for the responses.

\note{
The returned \code{satpt} object will contain \code{NULL} values for \code{test} and
\code{hindex} when \code{by} is not specified. This is done because \code{satpt} assumes
\code{by} is only specified when the data is collected in intervals.

data(ein)

# Assuming response bias is not a possiblity
satpt::satpt(y = ein$responses)

# Examining saturation given data collected at different times and
# response bias is possible.
satpt::satpt(y = ein$responses, by = ein$wave)
