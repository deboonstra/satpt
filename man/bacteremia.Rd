survey data}
\format{
\subsection{\code{bacteremia}}{

A \code{list} with 15 objects that each have a length of 669.
\describe{
\item{\code{q1}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to question 1
case study.}
\item{\code{q2}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to question 2
case study.}
\item{\code{q3}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to preferred
choice of valve imaging in a patient with MSSA bacteremia.}
\item{\code{q4}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses on how to treat
a clinically stable patient that has MRSA bacteremia.}
\item{\code{q5}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses on
antibiotic treatment strategy for a patient with MRSA endocarditis on day 6
of vancomycin with persistent positive blood cultures.}
\item{\code{q6}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to the treatment
course for a 35 y/o previously healthy man with left-sided MSSA endocarditis
but no meningitis or CNS disease.}
\item{\code{q7_bc}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to how often
repeat blood cultures from 24 hours to 48 hours until negative is used when
evaluating a patient with SAB.}
\item{\code{q7_echo}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to how often
a TTE and/or TEE is used when evaluating a patient with SAB.}
\item{\code{q7_spine}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to how often
a MRI of the spine is used when evaluating a patient with SAB.}
\item{\code{q7_abd}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to how often
a CT of the abdominal/pelvic area is used when evaluating a patient with
SAB.}
\item{\code{q7_eye}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to how often
a dilated eye exam is used when evaluating a patient with SAB.}
\item{\code{q9}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to dosage of
daptomycin for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.}
\item{\code{q10}}{A \code{character} vector that lists the responses to management
strategy and decision regarding anticoagulation on patients with MSSA
bacteremia and a deep vein thrombus at the site of a recently removed PICC
line.}
\item{\code{q8}}{A \code{data.frame} of 7 \code{character} variables that indicate whether
response resulted in the selection of the \emph{select all apply} response item.
The responses are focused on what conditions would increase the treatment
duration from 2 weeks to 4-6 weeks assuming that a TTE and/or TEE are
negative in a patient with MRSA bacteremia. If the response item was
selected a value of \code{Yes} is reported while \code{No} indicates the condition was
not selected.}
\item{\code{wave}}{A \code{numeric} vector that lists of the data collect period when
the responses were collected during.}

\description{
Responses to survey questions about infectious disease
consultation for \emph{staphylococcus aureus} bacteremia (SAB) presented to medical
personnel who are members of EIN.
}
\details{
Questions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are clinical case study questions, where the
remaining questions ask about different treatment methodologies. Questions 1
and 2 provide a medical history in the case study, which is excluded in
the descriptions of the responses for \code{q1} and \code{q2a}. These questions are
asking what would be the treatment strategy of an infectious disease
physician given the full medical history of the patients.
