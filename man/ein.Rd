\subsection{\code{ein}}{

A \code{data.frame} with 643 observations and 3 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{wave}}{The data collect period the responses were collected
during.}
\item{\code{q1}}{The responses to the types of advanced molecular
diagnostic tests that have been ordered or used. This is an example of
responses based on select that all apply data collection process. Possible
values are \emph{Broad range 16S rRNA gene sequencing} (\code{Broadrange}), \emph{Whole
genome sequencing} (\code{Wholegenome}), \emph{Metagenomic next-generation sequencing}
(\code{MNGS}), \emph{None of the above} (\code{None}), and \emph{Other} (\code{Other}), where the
data values are listed within the parentheses. When multiple responses are
present the data values are separated by \code{"|"}.}
\item{\code{q2}}{The responses to how often within the past two years
advanced molecular diagnostic testing was performed. Possible values are
\emph{Not at all}, \emph{Once}, \emph{Rarely} (quarterly or less often), \emph{Sometimes}
(monthly), and \emph{Often} (weekly). This is an example of where the responses
collected come from the multinomial distribution.}
