This *R* package identifies the saturation point of multinomial responses from a survey using standard errors of sample proportions.

## Installation
You can install the current stable released version of `satpt` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("satpt")
```

**when available on CRAN**.

### Development version
To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of `satpt` from [GitHub](https://github.com/deboonstra/satpt).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("deboonstra/satpt")
```

## Usage

For basic usage of `satpt` simply specify the responses of the survey in `y` and the data collection period information in `by`, as seen below. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(satpt) # load package
data(diagnoses) # load example diagnoses data
res <- satpt::satpt(y = diagnoses$q2, by = diagnoses$wave)
print(res)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(diagnoses)
res <- satpt::satpt(y = diagnoses$q2, by = diagnoses$wave)
print(res)
```

Saturation of each individual response category may be examined graphically while comparing the standard errors to the saturation threshold.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
graphics::par(oma = c(0, 0, 0, 8))
plot(res)
# adding legend
satpt::legend_right(
  legend = "Saturation\nthreshold",
  col = "firebrick", lty = 3, lwd = 2,
  cex = 0.75
)
```

## Methodology

Presented below is a simplified version of the algorithm that is employed in `satpt` to determine whether saturation of the responses has been achieved and whether pooled standard errors should be calculated to account for response bias.
